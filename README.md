# What is this?

Back when I worked as a Merchandiser for Coca-Cola, doing timesheets were a pain so using my severely broken knowledge of PHP, I put together this thing which basically calculates how many hours I've worked based on start and end times.

# Should I use it?

Hell no! For one, you'll get errors about it relying on the system timezone which it shouldn't but I had no idea what was best practice. I think I wrote, well, hacked together this thing back in early 2014 or so?

# What can I do with the code?

Probably nothing! It's definitely not something that follows the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle in anyway whatsoever.

I'm basically just putting it up here because I'm deleting old stuff off my webserver. It also looks good if I can show a % of my pushed code is done in PHP ;)
